# Day 2: React App Setup with Vite and Form Submission

## Overview

This project is part of the "100 Days of React" challenge, where I am building React apps daily. On Day 2, I explored how to set up a React project using Vite and learned about handling form submissions in React.

### Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the application here: [Live Demo](https://100-days-of-react-aryz.vercel.app/)

### Features

- **Form Submission:** Users can fill out a form and submit it, with form data being processed or logged.
- **Input Validation:** Basic form validation ensures that users cannot submit empty fields.

### Concepts Learned

- **Vite Setup:** Learned how to set up a React app using Vite, which offers faster builds and a better development experience.
- **Handling Form Submission:** Implemented controlled components and form handling in React.
- **State Management:** Used the `useState` hook to manage form data in a React component.
- **Form Validation:** Added basic input validation to prevent form submission with invalid data.
